Jamflox is a fork of the open source Runescape client 'Runelite' but with the good features re-enabled. 

## Project Layout

For all information regarding project layout or other technical details, refer to [Runelite's readme](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/runelite)

## Usage

Again, go read the [Runelite readme](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/runelite). Installable versions of this project are not provided. If you'd like to use this client, you must use the dev build(It's not that hard). This is intentional in order to create some minimum barrier to entry. 

Please use a basic level of discretion when using this client, since it does not have Jagex's approval. Don't post links to this page on reddit.

### License

RuneLite is licensed under the BSD 2-clause license. See the license header in the respective file to be sure.

## Contribute and Develop

PRs are welcome.
