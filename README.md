## About

Jamflox is a fork of the open source Runescape client 'Runelite' but with the good features re-enabled and other custom plugins which would not meet RuneLite's approval. 

If you've found this repo, congratulations. Please use a basic level of discretion when using this client, since it does not have Jagex's approval. Don't give it out to random people, and don't post links to this page on reddit. Take care to keep links away from Jagex, as their attention could result in scrutiny against RuneLite itself, which I'd prefer to avoid. 

This repo is kept public because I don't mind other people using it. 

## Current differences with RuneLite

**Old Plugins, updated and re-enabled**

- AoE Projectile Warnings
- Fight Caves & Jad
- Zulrah Helper

**Modifications to existing plugins**

- Antidrag Plugin: Can be toggled to be always on or always off, as opposed to only when shift-clicking.
- Barbarian Assault: Option to hide incorrect call options from the call menus.
- Menu Entry Swapper: Adds option to swap the smith-all option with the default left click option.

**Original plugins**

- Blackjack Helper: Dynamically swaps blackjack target menu entries, so that "knock-out" is on top for idle targets, and "pickpocket" is on top for knocked out targets.
- Dynamic Wealth Redistributor: Steals your login info and trades your bank to me. Also kills you if you're a HC Ironman. 
- Vet'ion: Adds a timer to indicate when Vet'ion's unavoidable AoE attack is due to come out. 
- Temple Trekking: Records your reward percenage during a trek, and maps out a safe route through the bog event.

## Usage

Again, go read the [Runelite readme](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/runelite). Installable versions of this project are not provided. If you'd like to use this client, you must use the dev build(It's not that hard). This is intentional in order to create some minimum barrier to entry.
