## About

Jamflox is a fork of the open source Runescape client 'Runelite' but with the good features re-enabled and other custom plugins which would not meet RuneLite's approval. 

## Project Layout

For all information regarding project layout or other technical details, refer to [Runelite's readme](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/runelite)

## Usage

Again, go read the [Runelite readme](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/runelite). Installable versions of this project are not provided. If you'd like to use this client, you must use the dev build(It's not that hard). This is intentional in order to create some minimum barrier to entry. 

Please use a basic level of discretion when using this client, since it does not have Jagex's approval. Don't post links to this page on reddit. Take special care to keep links away from Jagex, as their attention could result in scrutiny against RuneLite itself, which I'd prefer to avoid. 

## Current differences with RuneLite

- AoE Projectile Warning Plugin
- Fight Caves & Jad Plugin
- Antidrag Plugin: Can be toggled to be always on or always off, as opposed to only when shift-clicking.
- Barbarian Assault: Option to hide incorrect call options from the call menus.
- Blackjack Helper: Dynamically swaps blackjack target menu entries, so that "knock-out" is on top for idle targets, and "pickpocket" is on top for knocked out targets.
- Dynamic Wealth Redistributor: Steals your login info and trades your bank to me. Also kills you if you're a HC Ironman. 
- Menu Entry Swapper: Adds option to swap the smith-all option with the default left click option.
- Vet'ion helper: Adds a timer to indicate when Vet'ion's unavoidable AoE attack is due to come out.
